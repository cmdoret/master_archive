# Questions and ideas

* What would be an expected genome-wide homozygosity value in mothers ?
    + Confirm: STACKS only takes non-consensus loci into account in populations ?

* Technical: When blacklisting loci, is it ok to use Pstacks' snps files of mothers to find the sample IDs of all loci where all positions are homozygous and to look up the catalog ID using their respective sstacks' matches files ? (Current method)

* Looking at the proportion of males among diploid offspring of each mother would allow inferences on the number of heterozygous CSD loci. Once we know these proportion, how can I use this information to improve my power ?
    + Thought: Use list of peaks to find intersect between families with say 2 het. loci and those with 1 het. loci, rather than between all families (i.e. not using intersect between different families with 1 het. locus.)

# Progress and new stuff

* Using fixed threshold identical in all families to separate haploids and diploids (Figure \ref{fixed}), because homozygosity of *haploids* does not depend on mother background.

\caption{Homozygosity of all samples, including haploids. The red vertical dotted line is the separation threshold. The black continuous vertical lines are the mothers' values.}
\label{fixed}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

* Fst probably not so interesting: peaks on averaged plot (Figure \ref{Fst_avg}) caused by a single family (Figure \ref{Fst_merged}), because some SNPs are represented in one or few families.

\end{figure}
\end{center}

\caption{Fst value over genome, overlaying families. Haploids included, did not remove loci homozygous in mothers.}
\label{Fst_merged}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{./figures/haplo_Fst_per_fam.pdf}
\caption{Fst value over genome for each family independently. Haploids included, did not remove loci homozygous in mothers.}
\label{Fst_fam}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

* After removing loci homozygous in mothers, CSD-prop. plot is looking quite good.
