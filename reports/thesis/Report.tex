\section*{Introduction}

\subsection*{New (from scratch)}

Sex determination is the master switch that orients the developmental trajectory of an organism towards one sex or the other. A wide variety of sex determination mechanisms have been identified across animal species, they can depend on genetic features, the sensing of environmental factors, or a combination of both. An active area of research in evolutionary biology focuses on the study of these mechanisms and the reasons why so many different strategies exist. Because of the abundant diversity of sex determination mechanisms they harbour, insects are a good system to investigate these fundamental questions.

Here we are interested in complementary sex determination (CSD) a simple genetic mechanism of sex determination which was proposed to be the ancestral system in Hymenoptera, one of the largest orders of insects comprising over 230,000 described species. All Hymenoptera are haplodiploid; females lay eggs which develop into haploid males if left unfertilized, or into diploid females if fertilized. \\
Although haploidy is a well described phenomenon, the genetics underlying the detection of haplodiploidy in the embryo are still very little studied. The molecular mechanism of CSD has only been described in the honeybee, but  it is known to occur in more than 60 hymenopteran species. In CSD species, only one or a few loci assume the role of sex determiners by acting as the switch underlying haplodiploidy. If two different alleles are present in the egg for at least one CSD locus, the organism develops into a female. Haploid eggs therefore develop into males as they are hemizygous for all loci. In diploid eggs, on the other hand, most individuals will be heterozygous for at least one CSD loci,and develop into females. However, in strongly inbred populations, such as artificially inbred laboratory strains, the low allelic diversity will eventually result in diploid individuals with all CSD loci homozygous. Such individuals will develop into abnormal diploid males, which, depending on the species, are not viable, sterile or have reduced fitness. The presence of such diploid males is typically used to infer the presence of CSD in a species, and the frequencies of these males in breeding experiments have been used to estimate the number of CSD loci in a species from mathematical models.\\
\textit{Lysiphlebus fabarum} is a haplodiploid parasitoid wasp with both sexual and asexual lineages where CSD is known to be the mechanism underlying sex determination. In asexual lineages, the meiotic product undergoes fusion with a polar body through central-fusion automixis and the resulting eggs are diploid and develop into females without requiring fertilization by a male. %As it has both reproductive polymorphism and a simple sex determination system, \textit{L. fabarum} has great potential as a model species for the study of questions relating to sex determination and the evolutionary maintenance of sex. 
In this study, we investigate the genetic basis of CSD in \textit{L. fabarum}. The genetics of CSD is only known in the honeybee (\textit{Apis mellifera}) where the \textit{csd} gene stems from a duplication of the ancestral \textit{fem}, a \textit{transformer} homolog. The \textit{csd} gene underwent strong positive selection which resulted in neo functionalization and it now acts as an RNA splicing protein acting on its paralog, \textit{fem}. Uncovering the mechanisms underlying CSD in a distant species will provide valuable insight into the evolution of sex determination in insects. Here, we show that \textit{L. fabarum} has ml-CSD and that the loci are close to the centromeres. Our results also suggest a different mechanism from the \textit{Apis mellifera} CSD which might have evolved independently.

\section*{Materials and methods}

\subsection*{Crossing experiments}
\textit{Performed prior to master project.}\\
A haploid male coming from an asexual family of \textit{Lysiphlebus fabarum} was crossed with an inbred sexual line. The offspring of asexual females at the 4th generation were used.

\subsection*{RAD-seq protocol}
\textit{Performed prior to master project.}\\
N samples of 4th generation \textit{Lysiphlebus fabarum } coming from X different asexual females kept in ethanol at -XX\degree C for XX months. They were sexed visually and prepared in 6 separate libraries, all following the same protocol from XXX. ddRAD-seq was performed on all samples using EcorI and MseI restriction enzymes and a fragments  of 200-450 bp were size selected on agarose gel. Single-end sequencing was performed using Illumina Miseq (or Hiseq 2500???). Samples were multiplexed in each library following the TruSeq multiplexing design and libraries were pooled pairwise on the same Illumina lane using different adapters (iA06 or iA12).

\subsection*{STACKS pipeline}
We use the STACKS software (version 1.30) \textbf{CITATION} to process RAD-seq data as it is versatile, lends itself well to the analysis of non-model species and is well documented.
Following quality control using fastqc (version 0.11), the raw reads were trimmed and demultiplexed using the "process radtags" module from the STACKS suite and two mismatches were allowed to detect adapters. The 96bp demultiplexed reads were mapped to the latest assembly of the \textit{L. fabarum} genome using BWA aln (version 0.7.2) with 4 mismatches allowed. Only uniquely mapped alignments were extracted using samtools (version 1.3). Stacks were generated from SAM files of unique hits using the Pstacks module, requiring a minimum stack depth (-m) of 3. The catalogue of loci was built with Cstacks allowing for a distance (-n) of 3 mismatches between samples at each locus. Individuals with less than 10\% total radtags compared to the average across all samples were excluded from the analysis. Populations was run pooling all samples together, requiring each locus to be present (-r) in at least 80\% of samples. The different STACKS parameters were selected following guidelines in \textbf{Paris et al. 2017}.

\subsection*{Ploidy separation}
Genome wide heteroyzgosity per individual was computed on all variant sites using the output VCF file from a first populations run with more stringent parameters. Only high confidence loci were included by requiring a minimum sequencing depth (-m) of 20 reads in populations, to minimize chances of assigning the wrong ploidy to any individual. A conservative threshold of 77\% heterozygosity among variant sites was determined empirically \textbf{(Figure SX)} and individuals above that threshold were considered haploid and excluded from the main populations run used the other analyses.

\subsection*{Categorizing families}
The proportion of males among diploid offspring was used to group families by number of heterozygous CSD loci in the mother. The total number of diploid males among non-sequenced individuals was inferred from sequenced individuals by extrapolating the rate of haploidy from sequenced individuals to the total number of males as follows:
\begin{center}
$N_{DM}=N_M*\frac{n_{dm}}{n_{dm}+n_{hm}}$\\
\end{center}
Where upper-case letters represent total individuals count in each family and lower-case letters represent sequenced individuals count in the family. $N_M$ is the number of males, $N_{HM}$ is the number of haploid males and $N_{DM}$ the number of diploid males.

The proportion of males among diploid offspring was then computed using the inferred number of diploid males. The families were classified using 1-dimensional k-means clustering on the proportion of males among diploid offspring and 2 scenarios were considered to decide the number of categories of families; either 2 CSD loci, resulting in 3 categories (k=3), or 3 CSD loci resulting in 7 categories (k=7).\\

\subsection*{Finding centromeres}
All fixed and variant sites were extracted using the --genomic parameter of the populations STACKS module. For families where the mother was available, we excluded all sites that were either homozygous or missing in the mother from the family. For other families, we excluded sites that were missing of homozygous in all offspring in the family. 
The proportion of heterozygous sites was computed along the chromosomes in two ways: 1) computing mean heterozygosity in a sliding window containing 30 sites with a step size of 1 site and 2) Using a local regression model with a span of 0.6 to obtain a smooth estimate curve. In each chromosome, the approximate centromere location was considered to be the minimum of the local regression curve.

\subsection*{Association mapping}
Case-control association mapping was used to score CSD-candidate SNPs based on their segregation pattern. The number of heterozygous males, heterozygous females, homozygous males and homozygous females was computed for every SNP and a one-sided Fisher exact-test was performed on the 2X2 contingency table. The alternative hypothesis was that the proportion of homozygous males at the SNP is higher than the proportion of homozygous females. P-values were corrected for multiple-testing using Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
